## Oasys Event Software

Oasys is an end to end Event experience.  Oasys encompasses everything from creating the events to displaying the user created content in this app.  This repository is for the Oasys app, but the content creation portal can be viewed [HERE](http://52.11.80.182/oasys/index.html).  This app is used mostly to display event information and local weather forecast.  There is also Uber deeplinking to attend events through Uber.  Screenshots are shown below:
